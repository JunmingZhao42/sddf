# Current Plan

1. Implement higher abstraction driver (closer to C version as opposed to pancake)
2. Follow copier verifast specs to come up with some Viper specs
3. After that proceed with two parallel paths:
    - Add some pancake syntax features
    - Refine it in Viper end to make it closer to pancake implementation

# Other todo
- Understand the reason for `reprocess` in `tx_provide()` etc.
